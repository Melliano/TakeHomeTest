## If I had more time...
I didn't want to spend too long on this problem so here's some things I would do if I had more time, and if I did in Angular.TS too where I'm more comfortable

- [ ] More tests...
- [ ] Cleaned up styling and applied more bootstrap items to give it a better design. Right now its just about functionality based off limited time.
- [ ] Clean up API layer, handle errors and responses more at that level than at higher level.
